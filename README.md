# Advent of Code 2023 in Rust

Solutions to AOC 2023 in Rust

## Goal

The goal of each solution is:

1. To be correct (obviously).
    * And to solve the problem in <1s on an M1 MacBook.
2. To be easy and fun to read and exhibit idiomatic Rust.
3. To share as much code between problems (a) and (b) to show the underlying structure
   subtending both halves.

## Note

I solved through 20a, but was not able to get 20b before I gave up.
